# Inter IIT Hackathon Project

## Project Name: MetaMask Integration for Enhanced Crypto Transactions

### Problem Statement
Develop a solution to integrate MetaMask wallet functionality into a mobile application, enabling secure and user-friendly cryptocurrency transactions for everyday users.

### Project Description
Our project aims to create a seamless integration of MetaMask wallet into a React Native mobile application. This integration will allow users to manage their cryptocurrency assets, perform transactions, and interact with decentralized applications (dApps) directly from their mobile devices. By bridging the gap between traditional mobile apps and blockchain technology, we're making crypto transactions more accessible and user-friendly for the average consumer.
